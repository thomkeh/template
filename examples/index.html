  <d-abstract>
    <p>We often think of Momentum<d-cite key="mercier2011humans"></d-cite> as a means of dampening oscillations and
      speeding up the iterations, leading to faster convergence. But it has other interesting behavior. It allows a
      larger range of step-sizes to be used, and creates its own oscillations. What is going on?</p>

    <h2 id="h2-survey">A Brief Survey of Techniques</h2>
    <p>Before diving in: if you haven’t encountered t-SNE before, here’s what you need to know about the math behind it.
      The goal is to take a set of points in a high-dimensional space and find a faithful representation of those points
      in a lower-dimensional space, typically the 2D plane. The algorithm is non-linear and adapts to the underlying
      data, performing different transformations on different regions. Those differences can be a major source of
      confusion.</p>
    <p>This is the first paragraph of the article. Test a long dash&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;here it is.
    And a short dash: &ndash;.
    </p>
    <p>Test for owner's possessive. Test for "quoting a passage." And another sentence. Or two. Some flopping fins; for
      diving.</p>
    <!-- <aside>Some text in an aside, margin notes, etc...</aside> -->
    <p>Here's a test of an inline equation <d-math>c = a^2 + b^2</d-math>. Also with configurable katex standards just
      using inline '<span>$</span>' signs: $x^2$. And then there's a block equation:</p>
    <d-math block>
      c = \pm \sqrt{ \sum_{i=0}^{n}{a^{222} + b^2}}
    </d-math>
    <p>Math can also be quite involved:</p>
    <d-math block>
      \frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}}
      {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
    </d-math>
    <h3 id="h3-citations">Citations</h3>
    <p>We can<d-cite bibtex-key="mercier2011humans"></d-cite> also cite

      <d-cite key="dong2014image,dumoulin2016guide,mordvintsev2015inceptionism"></d-cite>.
      We should also be testing footnotes

        <h2 id="h2-politics">Politics and the English language</h2>
        <p>Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language—so the argument runs—must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.</p>

<p>Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English language as it is now habitually written.</p>
